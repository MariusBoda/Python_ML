# Aalto University summer course: Machine Learning with Python

This is my repository for my work in this Machine Learning with Python summer course. 

**Course Structure**

The course is divided into several modules, each covering different aspects of machine learning. The modules are organized as follows:

**0_Intromlpython2023a:** In this assignment, I gained familiarity with Python programming and explored essential libraries used in ML. I successfully completed tasks related to data preprocessing, data visualization, and data manipulation techniques.
