Aalto University summer course: Machine Learning with Python

This is my repository for my work in this Machine Learning with Python summer course. 

**Course Structure**

The course is divided into several modules, each covering different aspects of machine learning. The modules are organized as follows:

Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning: This module provides an overview of machine learning and its applications. You will learn about different types of machine learning algorithms and their characteristics.

Module 2: Data Preprocessing: In this module, you will learn how to preprocess and prepare data for machine learning tasks. Topics include handling missing data, feature scaling, and dealing with categorical variables.

Module 3: Regression: This module focuses on regression algorithms. You will learn about linear regression, polynomial regression, and how to evaluate regression models.

Module 4: Classification: In this module, you will explore classification algorithms. Topics include logistic regression, decision trees, and evaluation metrics for classification models.

Module 5: Clustering: This module covers clustering algorithms. You will learn about k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and evaluation metrics for clustering.

Module 6: Dimensionality Reduction: This module introduces dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE.

Module 7: Model Selection and Evaluation: In the final module, you will learn about techniques for model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using cross-validation.
